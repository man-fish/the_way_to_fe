# MinusOne #2583

Use the recursive continuous expansion of tuples while obtaining the length attribute to achieve the cumulative effect.

```
// your answers
type PH = '_';

export type MinusOne<T extends number> = helper<[], T>;

type helper<T extends any[], U extends number> = [...T, PH]['length'] extends U
    ? T['length']
    : helper<[...T, PH], U>;

type Zero = MinusOne<1>; // 0
type FiftyFour = MinusOne<3>; // 2
type TEN = MinusOne<41>; // 0
type FortyFive = MinusOne<46>; // 45

type FortyNine = MinusOne<50>; // Error: Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite.
```

But there is a small question. When the level of recursion exceeds 50, the ts compiler seems to think that the recursion is excessively deep and possibly infinite, then it throws an error.

After google, i got this. In `src/compiler/checker.ts` on line 13208 (in v3.7.2) there is the following code:

```
function instantiateType(type: Type | undefined, mapper: TypeMapper | undefined): Type | undefined {
    if (!type || !mapper || mapper === identityMapper) {
        return type;
    }
    if (instantiationDepth === 50 || instantiationCount >= 5000000) {
        // We have reached 50 recursive type instantiations and there is a very high likelyhood we're dealing
        // with a combination of infinite generic types that perpetually generate new type identities. We stop
        // the recursion here by yielding the error type.
        error(currentNode, Diagnostics.Type_instantiation_is_excessively_deep_and_possibly_infinite);
        return errorType;
    }
    instantiationCount++;
    instantiationDepth++;
    const result = instantiateTypeWorker(type, mapper);
    instantiationDepth--;
    return result;
}
```

The value is hard-coded. Perhaps a configuration option to change this might be warranted. As a workaround for now, you could try upping this limit and rebuilding the compiler.
