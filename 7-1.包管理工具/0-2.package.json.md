## description

The best way to manage locally installed npm packages is to create a `package.json` file.

## cli

To create a `package.json` with values that you supply, run:

```bash
> npm init
```

This will initiate a command line questionnaire that will conclude with the creation of a `package.json` in the directory in which you initiated the command.

```bash
> npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.
package name: (javascript)
version: (1.0.0)

entry point: (index.js)
test command:
git repository:

About to write to /Users/inno/projects/javascript/package.json:

{
  "name": "javascript",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}


Is this OK? (yes)
```

#### Default Config

To get a default `package.json`, run `npm init` with the `--yes` or `-y` flag:

```bash
> npm init --yes
```

This method will generate a default `package.json` using information extracted from the current directory.

```bash
> npm init --yes

  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/my_package/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/my_package"
}
```

> If there is no description field in the `package.json`, npm uses the first line of the `README.md` or README instead. The description helps people find your package when searching npm, so it's definitely useful to make a custom description in the `package.json` to make your package easier to find.

#### Customize Config

If you expect to create many package.json files, you might wish to customize the questions asked during the init process, so that the files always contain key information that you expect. You can customize the fields as well as the questions that are asked.

To do this, you create a custom `.npm-init.js` in your home directory `~/.npm-init.js`like this.

```ts
module.exports = {
  customField: 'Custom Field',
  otherCustomField: 'This field is really cool'
}
```

## Specifying Dependencies

To specify the packages your project depends on, you need to list the packages you'd like to use in your `package.json` file. There are 2 types of packages you can list:

- `dependencies`: These packages are required by your application in production.
- `devDependencies`: These packages are only needed for development and testing.

```json
{
  "name": "my_package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "my_dep": "^1.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies" : {
    "my_test_framework": "^3.1.0"
  }
}
```
